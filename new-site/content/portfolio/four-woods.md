The Four Woods Podcast, part of my senior project for my Media X degree at University of the Pacific, is an audio drama podcast about Ross Hansen, a 16-year-old kid who attends magical high school for the first time in his life after meeting his parents who he hasn't seen for thirteen years. A pilot episode of the podcast is currently available wherever you get your podcasts with more on the way in the coming months.

**Skills**: Adobe Audition, Scriptwriting, Directing for Voiceover
