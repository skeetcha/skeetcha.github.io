### Update on the Four Woods Podcast

Hey! I have an update on my audio drama podcast, The Four Woods Podcast. I've done some research and I'm moving forward in the pre-production process for season 1 of the show. Right now, all I've got is a budget outline for how much I'm going to need to raise to pay the actors, the writers that I'm going to bring on, the editors that I'm going to bring on (that's audio editors, not script editors), as well as myself. It's currently looking to be around $15,000, but I don't have exact numbers yet, and I won't have exact numbers until I figure out some specific things like any characters that I'm going to need to add for later episodes in the season. I'm considering making a Patreon, but I already have my [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/cityboundforest) set up and it can take monthly donations, so I'm tempted to use that instead. Let me know which you'd rather me use (Patreon or Ko-Fi) in the comments below. Any money coming in through Ko-Fi with the express mention of the podcast will go to the podcast (and if I make a Patreon, I'll put some percentage that I'll figure out later into the podcast); otherwise, it'll just go to me through my usual channels (similar to my Twitch subscriptions or StreamElements tips). In any case, things are looking up for the podcast and I'm excited to see where things are going to go. Keep an eye out on this space as well as my other socials to hear more about this and I'll see you later!!!
