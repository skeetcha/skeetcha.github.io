Hey everyone! I've been working on editing the update video for the Four Woods Podcast so that is coming soon (I recently switched to a new video editing program, so it's been A Time{{< rawhtml >}}<sup>tm</sup>{{< /rawhtml >}} to learn, but I'm starting to get into a groove with it), so stay tuned for that. I'm also still working on getting subtitles added to the YouTube video for the first episode of the show, so the update video won't come out until those are finished. Until the video releases, here's this week's stream schedule!

![Stream schedule for February 28 - March 5, 2022. All streams are at 1:00 pm PST. Monday's stream is Pokemon GenLocke I: FireRed with a re-run at 11:20 am PST. Wednesday's stream is The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask with a re-run at 10:40 am PST. Thursday's stream is Fire Emblem: Three Houses with a re-run at 11:10 am PST.

That's all from me, see you over on Twitch!
