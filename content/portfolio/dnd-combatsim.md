I took the Application Development course at University of the Pacific to learn how to work on a team to develop an application. In our groups, we proposed our final projects for the class and began our work. There were no roles, so I took initiative to be the Project Manager along with doing basic coding on the JSON data and general backend programming.

**Skills**: Java, JavaScript, Project Management

Because we used data from 5e.tools, I am not including a link to the repository here.
