During my junior year of high school, my dad approached me with an offer to work on a project involving a simulated sattelite in an enclosure the size and shape of a soda can run by an Arduino. He connected me and two of his students to Ted Tagami of Magnitude.io and we were all connected with Dr. Elizabeth Basha and her students at University of the Pacific. The CanSat project was eventually launched into low-Earth orbit in November 2019.

**Skills**: C++, Arduino
