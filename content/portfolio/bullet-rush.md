I took the Computer Game Technologies course at University of the Pacific in Fall 2019 to learn Video Game Design and Development. After pitching ideas to the class similarly to my earlier Application Development course, I was placed as the Project Manager of the Bullet Rush team along with a Lead Programmer, a general Programmer, and a Media Director. At the end of the course, we presented to the community for feedback.

**Skills**: Unity, C#, Project Management, Agile Development
