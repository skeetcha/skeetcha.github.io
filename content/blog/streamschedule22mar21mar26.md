Hey everyone! After Friday's stream, I'll be pulling Octopath Traveler from the lineup. That being said, I'll still complete the other series I have going on my Twitch channel, and I'll even been introducing a sub goal! When I reach 15 subs, I'll do a special Ocarina of Time: Beta Quest stream in full Link cosplay! Can't wait to get there, so let's keep trucking along. Anyway, onto the stream schedule!

![Stream schedule for this week; all streams are at 1:00 pm PDT. Monday's stream is Pokemon GenLocke I: FireRed with a re-run at 11:15 am PDT. Friday's stream is Fire Emblem: Three Houses with a re-run at 11:30 am PDT. Saturday's stream is Minecraft with my friend KniightRyder with a re-run at 11:10 am PDT.](https://imgur.com/oLOjZr0.png)
