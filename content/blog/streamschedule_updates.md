Hello everyone! I'm back with some more announcements!

#### Twitch Stream Schedule

I have a new stream schedule for this week! Here it is!

Wednesday's stream is The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask with a re-run at 11:05 am PST. Thursday's stream is Fire Emblem: Three Houses with a re-run at 10:55 am PST. Friday's stream is Octopath Traveler with a re-run at 11:00 am PST.](https://imgur.com/zVuuK6D.png)

#### Podcasts

I'm currently trying to work on editing together a D&D actual play podcast surrounding the Skull & Shackles Adventure Path written for Pathfinder 1st Edition (although we play in Pathfinder 2nd Edition). Since I'm the only editor on the project and it's not my only priority (as streaming takes up most of my time alongside finding a stable job), it's been taking me a while to edit the first episode, but when it comes out, you'll be able to get an update here on my blog as well as on all of my social media accounts. The problem with me being the only editor on the project is that I *also* run the game and we're also like 20 sessions in. And we're starting sessions back up this upcoming week. So I have a lot of work to do on that.

In any case, I've worked out a kind of budget when it comes to paying the voice actors for my audio drama podcast The Four Woods Podcast. Beyond that, I'll need to, well, ask them whether or not they would be willing to return for the rest of the podcast as well as find writers and editors for the show.

In any case, that's all I've got on this front for blog posts. I'm still wondering what else to put on this blog other than my stream updates and creative updates.
