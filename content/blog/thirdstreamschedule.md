Hey everyone! I'm back with another stream schedule! Also I've found that I've started to use this blog just to post my stream schedules and other creative updates and while I certainly want to keep doing that, I feel like it has a bigger purpose than that, but I haven't necessarily figured out what that is yet.

Anyways, here's the stream schedule!

![Stream schedule for January 24 - 28. All streams are at 1:00 pm PST. Monday's stream is Pokemon GenLocke Part 1: FireRed with a re-run at 11:25 am PST. Wednesday's stream is Majora's Mask with a re-run at 11:05 am PST. Thursday's stream is Fire Emblem: Three Houses with a re-run at 11:10 am PST. Friday's stream is Octopath Traveler with a re-run at 11:10 am PST.](https://imgur.com/3fRnOvI.png)

That's all from me for this post, see you over on Twitch!
