Hey everyone! I'm going to pull back on the number of streams I'm doing each week, but I won't be pulling back on the content that I'm putting out; I'll still be finishing all of the series that I've started on my Twitch channel, so don't worry! Anyway, onto the stream schedule for this week.

![Stream schedule for March 14 - 18, 2022; all streams are at 1:00 pm PDT. Monday's stream is Pokemon GenLocke I: FireRed with a re-run at 11:15 am PDT. Wednesday's stream is The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask with a re-run at 10:40 am PDT. Friday's stream is Octopath Traveler with a re-run at 11:10 am PDT.](https://imgur.com/XSPyQk2.png)
