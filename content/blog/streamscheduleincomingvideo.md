### The Four Woods Podcast Update

Sometime this week, I will be posting a video outlining everything in the future for The Four Woods Podcast. This includes the budget that I've been mentioning here on the blog as well as a call for writers to send in applications to write for the podcast. When the video is posted, I'll link to it on my Twitter page and I'll post it on my Instagram and TikTok accounts. I'll also be linking to it here, so if you've subscribed to the [RSS feed](https://skeetcha.github.io/blog-rss.xml), then you'll be able to know when it comes out.

In any case, that's all from me. See you over on Twitch!
