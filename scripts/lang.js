    "project.mememachine.long-description": "This was a project created by the University of the Pacific chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery in March of 2017 to create a set of software to download and aggregate memes from different social media sites to which memes are uploaded, rate them by some sort of combined metric made up of data from each of the different sites, and then use all of that data to then create its own memes. The project was discontinued roughly a month later.\n\nThe project uses primarily Python in its code, although one of us wanted to use Haskell to download memes from ImgFlip's meme generator. I looked a little at Haskell although I wouldn't say that I can explain line by line what the code does.",

    "project.shutin.long-description": "This was a short film created as part of the Go Film! Workshop held at the San Joaquin County Office of Education in June 2012. During the first of two weeks, we learned the fundamentals of creating a short film and then we pitched our projects and chose what would end up being the final product. The second week then comprised of pre-production, filming over the course of a full day on-location at a daycare in Manteca, CA, and then finishing up post-production until late into the night.\n\n\n\nThe film was then premiered at the Lincoln High School theatre to a packed house after which the crew got up on stage and held a short Q+A session with the audience. As far as I'm aware (as I was not told about this and found out through social media), the short film was also entered into a short film contest in which it won an award.",

We were to pitch ideas to the class and then everyone voted on which projects they wanted to work on and what roles they had desired. Since I had already worked as a Project Manager on my Application Development team (even though I was never officially designated as such), I chose that role. I was assigned to the Bullet Rush team and oversaw the development of the game.\n\n\n\nWe were a small team of four working on this project with a Lead Programmer, a generic Programmer, and a Media Director also assigned to the project. Our final for the class consisted of our project showcase where our classmates (and anyone else we had invited) could play our games and give us feedback.",

    "project.dndcombatsim.long-description": "During the Fall 2018 semester, I took the Application Development course at University of the Pacific where I learned the joys and perils of working on a team to develop some piece of software. We were assigned into groups and told to come up with a project proposal for the final project of the class. Next came writing up system requirements documents and having team meetings each week (usually) to discuss and work on the program. Unlike the Bullet Rush project that I was later part of the next year, we didn't have specific roles; we mostly just chose them in amongst our teams. I saw the position of team leader/project manager unfilled and I rose to fill it.\n\n\n\nThe program takes information from the website 5e.tools in the form of a JSON lookup table and spawns in monster information along with weapon information and a bit of randomness to make the combat simulator work. In the programming field, I mostly worked on sorting through all of the JSON data to make it contain only the data we needed for the project. I also worked to implement the JSON data into the program along with other general backend programming.",

    "project.cansat.long-description": "When I was in my third year of high school, my dad (who taught at my high school) offered me and a couple of his Computer Science students an offer to work on an after school project involving a simulated sattelite in the shape and size of a soda can run by an Arduino. I had messed around with an Arduino a little bit and had taken the Digital Design course at San Joaquin Delta College (which was likely called something else, but Digital Design is the equivalent course at University of the Pacific) so I knew a little bit about the skills the project would require. Eventually, we were connected with Ted Tagami of Magnitude.io with the project and eventually he took the project and pushed it into schools.\n\n\n\nI ended up taking an internship with Magnitude to help them give out CanSats and their other program known as the ExoLab to teachers and students in my local area. However, when I was in my last year of high school, I was part of adapting the CanSat project into a larger project that would go up into low-Earth orbit. That project consisted of working both with Magnitudio.io engineers and with students at the University of Pacific School of Engineering and Computer Science under Dr. Elizabeth Basha. The CanSat was eventually launched into low-Earth orbit in November 2019.",

    "about.quote": "\"Creativity is an energy. It's a precious energy, and it's something to be protected. A lot of people take for granted that they're a creative person, but I know from experience, feeling it in myself, it is a magic; it is an energy. And it can't be taken for granted.\" --Ava DuVernay",

    "about.bio.1": "Every person is a story, and storyteller Cass Unterholzner is no different. He has been telling stories when he was younger. He pursued and is pursuing his creative cravings through short films, acting and playing music in musical theatre, developing and critiquing video games, and writing and recording music.",
    "about.bio.2": "Even before entering high school, Cass participated in the a \"Go Film!\" workshop at the San Joaquin County Office of Education in Stockton, California learning about camera, lighting, and sound techniques. He worked with other teens to create and release a short film, as the Gaffer, the Foley Artist, and a Sound Editor. In high school, Cass took a class expanding his film knowledge in creating the school's announcements. After graduating, he started a YouTube channel where he posted short videos.",
    "about.bio.3": "Along with working in film, Cass also participated in musical theatre. He appeared in many productions starting in 2007 with \"Dear Edwina Jr\" at Stockton Civic Theatre as well as many church musicals. In 2009, Cass starred in \"The Music Man\" for a senior project in Manteca, California. Later, he was cast as Professor Quirrel and was set to be the Musical Director for a production of \"A Very Potter Musical\" while directing and developing a Murder Mystery Dinner containing mostly improvised scenes.",
    "about.bio.4": "Cass has always been interested in video game development and design as he played them often throughout his adolescence. This interest flourished and inspired him to major in Computer Science, first at San Joaquin Delta College and then University of the Pacific. He ended up switching his major to Media X to further pursue his passions. During his coursework, he worked with classmates to develop two games: a combat simulator for the tabletop role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons and a bullet-dodging game like the video game Cuphead. Cass intends to continue using video games as an alternate form of storytelling in the future.",
    "about.bio.5": "Music has always been part of Cass's life. Inspired by his older sister taking lessons, he decided to learn piano at age 5. He later picked up more instruments such as the clarinet, the cello, and the guitar. Cass was active in his high school's band program where he took to arranging and writing for his school's wind ensemble and jazz band. He also played cello often in college and assisted East Union High School's theatre class in a production of \"Next to Normal.\" In 2019, Cass sent a video of him playing an original song to the University of the Pacificâs student association. This resulted in Cass playing both original and cover songs at their Brickyard Series concert. Cass now writes indie pop music in his spare time.",
    "about.bio.6": "Cass hopes to further his storytelling career using his YouTube channel talking about gaming, music, and languages. His free time consists of learning German, American Sign Language, Spanish, and Italian. When he's not crafting fantasy novels, Cass plays and runs sessions of various tabletop role-playing games for which he hopes to develop a podcast in the future.",
