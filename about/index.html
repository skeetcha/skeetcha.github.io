                <p>Every person is a story, and storyteller Daniel Unterholzner is no different. Through the different types of media in his practice, he artistically conveys his and others’ stories. Daniel has always been interested in the act of storytelling, even from a young age. This practice of creating stories propelled him to take part in a film workshop, musical theatre, and music-related outlets.</p>
                <p>Before entering high school, Daniel participated in the "Go Film!"" workshop at the San Joaquin County Office of Education in Stockton, California learning about camera, lighting, and sound techniques. He worked with other teens to create and release a short film as the Gaffer, the Foley Artist and uncredited as a Sound Editor. In high school, Daniel took a class expanding his film knowledge where he created the school’s announcements. After graduating, he started a YouTube channel and used his film skills to produce short videos. Along with working in film, Daniel also participated in musical theatre.</p>
                <p>Daniel appeared in many productions starting in 2007 with "Dear Edwina Jr" at Stockton Civic Theatre and many church musicals. In 2009, Daniel starred in “The Music Man” for a senior project in Manteca, California. He then took a break to focus on Computer Science at university. In 2020, he starred in and was the Musical Director for a production of "A Very Potter Musical" while directing and writing a Murder Mystery Dinner containing mostly improvised scenes. Furthermore, Daniel is also fascinated with video game design and development.</p>
                <p>Daniel has always been interested in video game development and design as he played them often throughout his adolescence. This interest flourished and inspired him to major in Computer Science, first at San Joaquin Delta College and then University of the Pacific. He ended up switching his major to Media X to further pursue his passions. During his coursework, he worked with classmates to develop two games: a combat simulator for the tabletop role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons and a bullet-dodging game like the video game Cuphead. Daniel intends to continue using video games as an alternate form of storytelling in the future. Like his fascination in video game design, Daniel has also taken an interest in the realm of music.</p>
                <p>Music has always been part of Daniel's life. Inspired by his older sister taking lessons, he decided to learn piano at age 5. He later picked up more instruments such as the clarinet, the cello, and the guitar. Daniel was active in his high school’s band program where he took to arranging and writing for his school’s wind ensemble and jazz band. He also played cello often in college and assisted East Union High School’s theatre class in a production of "Next to Normal." In 2019, Daniel sent a video of him playing an original song to the University of the Pacific’s student association. This resulted in Daniel playing both original and cover songs at their Brickyard Series concert. Daniel now writes indie pop music in his spare time.</p>
                <p>Daniel hopes to further his storytelling career using his YouTube channel talking about gaming, music, and languages. His free time consists of learning German, American Sign Language, Spanish, and Italian. When he’s not adapting The Odyssey for musical theatre, Daniel plays and runs sessions of various tabletop role-playing games for which he hopes to develop a podcast in the future.</p>
