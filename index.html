He has always been telling stories when he was younger through media such as short films, acting and playing music in musical theatre, developing and critiquing video games, and writing and recording music. Daniel started with working on a short film as a Foley Artist, the Gaffer, and a Sound Editor. He also gained experience creating his school’s announcements. Daniel later started a YouTube channel. Along with working in film, Daniel also participated in musical theatre, appearing in productions such as "Dear Edwina Jr," "The Music Man," and "Joseph and the Technicolor Dreamcoat."</p><p>Daniel has always been interested in the development and design of video games. He originally studied Computer Science but is now a Media X major. Daniel created two video games during his coursework: a Dungeons and Dragons combat simulator and a bullet-dodging game. Daniel intends to continue developing video games. Music has always been part of Daniel's life. When he was young, he decided to learn piano, picking up more instruments as he improved. He had the opportunity to play cello for a production of “Next to Normal.” Daniel performed at a Brickyard Series concert at University of the Pacific. Daniel now writes indie pop music in his spare time.</p><p>Daniel hopes to further his storytelling career using his YouTube channel talking about gaming, music, and languages. His free time consists of learning German, American Sign Language, Spanish, and Italian. He hopes to adapt The Odyssey for musical theatre and create a podcast for a tabletop role-playing game.</p></div>
